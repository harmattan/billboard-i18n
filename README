If you want to contribute:

  1. Download the most recent en.ts

     (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
  3. Use Qt Linguist to translate the file
     (install Qt SDK or use http://code.google.com/p/qtlinguistdownload/)
  4. Submit the translation as pull request

By submitting the translation you agree to release the translation under the
ISC license (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license):

translations in Billboard right now, as well as allow the translation to be
used when Billboard is open sourced at some point in the future.
